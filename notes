to apply inline js we write body onload="whatever we want the javascript "

look into quotation marks

position of the placement of script tag matters(loading of js on the site-----> so put at last since it laso takes a long time to load, also all the commands will be loaded later only.) .
Dom turns the elements and their data into a tree structure with a whole bunch of objects you can select and manipulate. 

document , .innerHTML
instead  of just heading.innerHTML     can use  heading.style.color="red"
.queryselector("whatever selector").click(); 

properties
#.innerHTML
#firstElementChild
#.style 

methods
#click() 
#setAttribute() 
#appendChild()
